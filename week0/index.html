    <h1 id="whales"><strong>Whales</strong></h1>
    <p>Whales are a widely distributed and diverse group of fully aquatic placental marine mammals. They are an
informal grouping within the infraorder Cetacea, usually excluding dolphins and porpoises. Whales, dolphins and
porpoises belong to the order Cetartiodactyla with even-toed ungulates and their closest living relatives are the
hippopotamuses, having diverged about 40 million years ago. The two parvorders of whales, baleen whales
(Mysticeti) and toothed whales Odontoceti), are thought to have split apart around 34 million years ago.

Whales are creatures of the open ocean; they feed, mate, give birth, suckle and raise their young at sea. So
extreme is
their adaptation to life
underwater that they are unable to survive on land. Whales range in size from the 2.6
metres
(8.5 ft) and 135 kilograms (298 lb) dwarf sperm whale to the 29.9 metres (98 ft) and 190 metric tons (210 short
tons)
blue whale, which is the largest creature that has ever lived. The sperm whale is the largest toothed predator on
earth. Several species exhibit sexual dimorphism, in that the females are larger than males. Baleen whales have
no
teeth; instead they have plates of baleen, a fringe-like structure used to expel water while retaining the krill
and
plankton which they feed on. They use their throat pleats to expand the mouth to take in huge gulps of water.
Balaenids
have heads that can make up 40% of their body mass to take in water. Toothed whales, on the other hand, have
conical
teeth adapted to catching fish or squid. Baleen whales have a well developed sense of "smell", whereas toothed
whales
have well-developed hearing - their hearing, that is adapted for both air and water, is so well developed that
some can
survive even if they are blind. Some species, such as sperm whales, are well adapted for diving to great depths
to
catch squid and other favoured prey.

    <p>Whales have torpedo shaped bodies with non-flexible necks, limbs modified into flippers, non-existent external
ear
flaps, a large tail fin, and flat heads (with the exception of monodontids and ziphiids). Whale skulls have small
eye
orbits, long snouts (with the exception of monodontids and ziphiids) and eyes placed on the sides of its head.

Whales
range in size from the 2.6-metre (8.5 ft) and 135-kilogram (298 lb) dwarf sperm whale to the 34-metre (112 ft)
and
190-metric-ton (210-short-ton) blue whale. Overall, they tend to dwarf other cetartiodactyls; the blue whale is
the
largest creature on earth. Several species have female-biased sexual dimorphism, with the females being larger
than the
males. One exception is with the sperm whale, which has males larger than the females.
      <br>
      <br>
Odontocetes, such as the sperm whale, possess teeth with cementum cells overlying dentine cells. Unlike human
teeth,
which are composed mostly of enamel on the portion of the tooth outside of the gum, whale teeth have cementum
outside
the gum. Only in larger whales, where the cementum is worn away on the tip of the tooth, does enamel show.
Mysticetes
have large whalebone, as opposed to teeth, made of keratin. Mysticetes have two blowholes, whereas Odontocetes
contain
only one.
      <br>
      <br>
Breathing involves expelling stale air from the blowhole, forming an upward, steamy spout, followed by inhaling
fresh
air into the lungs; a humpback whale's lungs can hold about 5,000 litres of air. Spout shapes differ among
species,
which facilitates identification.
      <br>
      <br>
The heart of a whale weighs about 180â€“200 kg. It is 640 times bigger than a human heart. The heart of the blue
whale is
the largest of any animal, and the walls of the arteries in the heart have been described as being "as thick
as an
iPhone 6 Plus is long".
      <br>
      <br>
All whales have a thick layer of blubber. In species that live near the poles, the blubber can be as thick as 11
inches.
This blubber can help with buoyancy (which is helpful for a 100-ton whale), protection to some extent as
      <img class="image-anatomy-of-a-whale-2" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8d/Sperm_whale_skeleton_labelled.jpg/1200px-Sperm_whale_skeleton_labelled.jpg"
 alt="Anatomy of a whale">
predators would have a hard time getting through a thick layer of fat, and energy for fasting when migrating to
the
equator; the primary usage for blubber is insulation from the harsh climate. It can constitute as much as 50% of
a
whale's body weight. Calves are born with only a thin layer of blubber, but some species compensate for this with
thick
lanugos.
      <br>
      <br>
Whales have a two- to three-chambered stomach that is similar in structure to terrestrial carnivores. Mysticetes
contain a proventriculus as an extension of the oesophagus; this contains stones that grind up food. They also
have
fundic and pyloric chambers.

    <p>
The whale ear has specific adaptations to the marine environment. In humans, the middle ear works as an impedance
equalizer between the outside air's low impedance and the cochlear fluid's high impedance. In whales, and other
marine
mammals, there is no great difference between the outer and inner environments. Instead of sound passing through
the
outer ear to the middle ear, whales receive sound through the throat, from which it passes through a
low-impedance
fat-filled cavity to the inner ear. The whale ear is acoustically isolated from the skull by air-filled sinus
pockets, which allow for greater directional hearing underwater. Odontocetes send out high frequency clicks
from an
organ known as a melon. This melon consists of fat, and the skull of any such creature containing a melon will
have a
large depression. The melon size varies between species, the bigger the more dependent they are of it. A beaked
whale
for example has a small bulge sitting on top of its skull, whereas a sperm whale's head is filled up mainly with
the
melon.
      <br>
      <br>
The whale eye is relatively small for its size, yet they do retain a good degree of eyesight. As well as this,
the eyes
of a whale are placed on the sides of its head, so their vision consists of two fields, rather than a binocular
view
like humans have. When belugas surface, their lens and cornea correct the nearsightedness that results from the
refraction of light; they contain both rod and cone cells, meaning they can see in both dim and bright light, but
they
have far more rod cells than they do cone cells. Whales do, however, lack short wavelength sensitive visual
pigments in
their cone cells indicating a more limited capacity for colour vision than most mammals. Most whales have
slightly
flattened eyeballs, enlarged pupils (which shrink as they surface to prevent damage), slightly flattened corneas
and a
tapetum lucidum; these adaptations allow for large amounts of light to pass through the eye and, therefore, a
very
clear image of the surrounding area. They also have glands on the eyelids and outer corneal layer that act as
protection for the cornea.
      <br>
      <br>
The olfactory lobes are absent in toothed whales, suggesting that they have no sense of smell. Some whales, such
as the
bowhead whale, possess a vomeronasal organ, which does mean that they can "sniff out" krill.
      <br>
      <br>
Whales are not thought to have a good sense of taste, as their taste buds are atrophied or missing altogether.
However,
some toothed whales have preferences between different kinds of fish, indicating some sort of attachment to
taste. The
presence of the Jacobson's organ indicates that whales can smell food once inside their mouth, which might be
similar
to the sensation of taste.

 alt="Compared Brain Sizes">
    <p>
Whales are known to teach, learn, cooperate, scheme, and grieve. The neocortex of many species of whale is
home to
elongated spindle neurons that, prior to 2007, were known only in hominids. In humans, these cells are
involved in
social conduct, emotions, judgement, and theory of mind. Whale spindle neurons are found in areas of the brain
that are
homologous to where they are found in humans, suggesting that they perform a similar function.
      <br>
      <br>
Brain size was previously considered a major indicator of the intelligence of an animal. Since most of the brain
is
used for maintaining bodily functions, greater ratios of brain to body mass may increase the amount of brain mass
available for more complex cognitive tasks. Allometric analysis indicates that mammalian brain size scales at
approximately the ? or Â¾ exponent of the body mass. Comparison of a particular animal's brain size with the
expected
brain size based on such allometric analysis provides an encephalisation quotient that can be used as another
indication of animal intelligence. Sperm whales have the largest brain mass of any animal on earth, averaging
8,000
cubic centimetres (490 in3) and 7.8 kilograms (17 lb) in mature males, in comparison to the average human brain
which
averages 1,450 cubic centimetres (88 in3) in mature males. The brain to body mass ratio in some odontocetes,
such
as belugas and narwhals, is second only to humans.
      <br>
      <br>
Small whales are known to engage in complex play behaviour, which includes such things as producing stable
underwater
toroidal air-core vortex rings or "bubble rings". There are two main methods of bubble ring production: rapid
puffing
of a burst of air into the water and allowing it to rise to the surface, forming a ring, or swimming repeatedly
in a
circle and then stopping to inject air into the helical vortex currents thus formed. They also appear to enjoy
biting
the vortex-rings, so that they burst into many separate bubbles and then rise quickly to the surface. Some
believe
this is a means of communication.[66] Whales are also known to produce bubble-nets for the purpose of
foraging.
      <br>
      <br>
Larger whales are also thought, to some degree, to engage in play. The southern right whale, for example,
elevates
their tail fluke above the water, remaining in the same position for a considerable amount of time. This is known
as
"sailing". It appears to be a form of play and is most commonly seen off the coast of Argentina and South Africa.
Humpback whales, among others, are also known to display this behaviour.

    <h2 id="life-cycle">Life cycle</h2>
    <p>
Whales are fully aquatic creatures, which means that birth and courtship behaviours are very different from
terrestrial
and semi-aquatic creatures. Since they are unable to go onto land to calve, they deliver the baby with the fetus
positioned for tail-first delivery.
      <img class="life-cycle-whales" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ce/Finhval_%281%29.jpg/330px-Finhval_%281%29.jpg"
 alt="A floating whale">
This prevents the baby from drowning either upon or during delivery. To feed
the
new-born, whales, being aquatic, must squirt the milk into the mouth of the calf. Being mammals, they have
mammary
glands used for nursing calves; they are weaned off at about 11 months of age. This milk contains high amounts of
fat
which is meant to hasten the development of blubber; it contains so much fat that it has the consistency of
toothpaste.[69] Females deliver a single calf with gestation lasting about a year, dependency until one to two
years,
and maturity around seven to ten years, all varying between the species. This mode of reproduction produces
few
offspring, but increases the survival probability of each one. Females, referred to as "cows", carry the
responsibility
of childcare as males, referred to as "bulls", play no part in raising calves.
      <br>
      <br>
Most mysticetes reside at the poles. So, to prevent the unborn calf from dying of frostbite, they migrate to
calving/mating grounds. They will then stay there for a matter of months until the calf has developed enough
blubber to
survive the bitter temperatures of the poles. Until then, the calves will feed on the mother's fatty milk.
With the
exception of the humpback whale, it is largely unknown when whales migrate. Most will travel from the Arctic or
Antarctic into the tropics to mate, calve, and raise during the winter and spring; they will migrate back to the
poles
in the warmer summer months so the calf can continue growing while the mother can continue eating, as they fast
in the
breeding grounds. One exception to this is the southern right whale, which migrates to Patagonia and western New
Zealand to calve; both are well out of the tropic zone.

    <br>
    <h2 id="sleep">Sleep</h2>
    <p>
Unlike most animals, whales are conscious breathers. All mammals sleep, but whales cannot afford to become
unconscious
for long because they may drown. While knowledge of sleep in wild cetaceans is limited, toothed cetaceans in
captivity
have been recorded to sleep with one side of their brain at a time, so that they may swim, breathe consciously,
and
avoid both predators and social contact during their period of rest.
      <br>
      <br>
A 2008 study found that sperm whales sleep in vertical postures just under the surface in passive shallow
'drift-dives', generally during the day, during which whales do not respond to passing vessels unless they are in
contact, leading to the suggestion that whales possibly sleep during such dives.
